      "1. Revenue: If the startup can successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of its AI healthcare technology and secure partnerships or clients within the healthcare industry, it could potentially generate substantial revenue. Much of this would depend on the startup's pricing model and its ability to consistently deliver value to clients.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mitigation Strategy: HealthTrack AI should invest in robust clinical studies and trials to prove the efficacy and reliability of their AI solutions. Additionally, they should engage regulatory consultants early on in the process and navigate the regulatory landscape proactively.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Financial Risk: Based on the financial expert's input, the startup has potentail high burn rate due to high developmental and regulatory costs along with uncertainty on return on investment due to unsure revenue streams.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitigation Strategy: To mitigate this risk, HealthTrack AI should focus on securing sustainable and diverse funding sources (grants, VC funding etc). The company can also control its burn rate by optimizing operations, strategically planning its R&D expenditures, and carefully planning its growth. \n",
